    *   Defines the FastAPI application instance.
    *   Includes REST endpoints for all the API paths specified in the service definition: `/orders`, `/orders/{orderId}`, `/orders/checkout`, `/cart`, `/cart/add`, `/cart/remove`, and `/cart/update`.
    *   Uses placeholder functions in the `services` module to handle the actual business logic.
    *   Includes basic error handling (e.g., `HTTPException` for "Order not found").
    *   Uses `Depends` to inject a dependency for order retrieval (DRY).


2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
3.  Install the dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4.  Run the application:
    uvicorn app:app --reload

Now you can access the API endpoints in your browser or using a tool like `curl` or Postman. For example:

*   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/orders`
*   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/orders/1`
*   `http://127.0.0.1:8000/cart`

This provides a solid foundation for building your `OrderService` with FastAPI. Remember to replace the placeholder implementations in `services.py` with your actual business logic and database interactions.  Also, consider adding proper logging and exception handling.
